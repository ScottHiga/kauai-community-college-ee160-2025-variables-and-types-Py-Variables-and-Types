# Python Variables and Types
&emsp; Shows you can use the basics of variables, and identify their types.

# Task List:

### 1:
&emsp; Create a new .py file define three variables with values 10000, 3, and 0.

### 2:
&emsp; Show that you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide using the variables you just defined. Using a comment, explain what happens when you divide by zero in your code.

### 3:
&emsp; Create two new variables with the values "hello" and "world". Use these varibles and some addition to print the text "hello world!". (NOTE THE EXTRA SPACE AND PUNCTUATION, THIS IS NOT A MISTAKE IN HOW I PHRASED THE PROBLEM) Using a comment, explain what happenes when you use subtraction or some other operation on these variables.

### 4:
&emsp; Change one of your int variables to a float, and print its type before and after. Using a comment, explain what happens if you try to do the same thing with one of your string variables.
